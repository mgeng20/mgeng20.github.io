### Writeup questions:

- What was the most challenging piece of this assignment? Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS? How long did this overall assignment take you?

  **The most challenging aspect of building my personal website was effectively managing the relationship between each block or component and its corresponding padding and margin settings. I find it easy to work with HTML and CSS as long as I am familiar with the elements and properties that I am using. I spent 2-3 days on this project.**

- What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?

  **I used media queries to adjust the margin/padding and flex/grid of each page. When the width is less than 786px, I arrange components vertically so they fit better on a mobile device screen. Some text and image sizes are also adjusted.**

- What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website? Is there anything that youâ€™re particularly proud of?

  **I invest a significant amount of time in font selection. Overall, I'm pleased with the outcome, and I believe my website exudes a professional and appealing aesthetic.**
